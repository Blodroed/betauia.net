    <h2 class="section-title">Scoring</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      For each game, there will be a scoring system. Generally, if the game has a built in scoring system of some 
      kind, that will be the one that will be considered. A contestants ranking in each individual game will be used to determine the
      amount of points the contestant gets on the overall leaderboards. To add more stakes to the games, for each game that passes, 
      a multiplier gets added to each players final score, starting from 1x and increasing by 0.5 each time. As such the later 
      rounds will be more important in determaning the winners.
