  To build a game jam game ready for the web, need to:
  - ask the maintainers for help
  - make build ready files with an `index.html`
  - make sure it is in: `<game-folder>`->`built`

    Building a python game:
    - install python
    - make a virtual environment with `python -m venv venv`
    - activate it
    - install dependencies with `pip`
    - install `pip install pygbag`
    - build web files: `pygbag .`
    - move build files to a folder named `built`
    - deactivate virtual environment
