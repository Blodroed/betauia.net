# what is a game jam
Game Jam is a sprint to create games. You have one week, starting with receiving a *theme*, and then you work until judging at the end of the week. The theme is the same for everyone and can be a single word. Examples from [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/history): *deception, repair, duality*.

Game Jam is an exercise in working under pressure, collaboration, and creativity.

### requirements
You can create the game almost however you want. Steal parts from others, use ChatGPT, create a board game if you wish! But remember that others should be able to play it during judging, and remember to tie it to the *theme* in some way.

Here are tools worth checking out for game developers:
