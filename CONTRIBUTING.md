## Pick your first issue

## Commit Conventions
Create atomic commits. This means the changes to the code should reflect one change, not more, not less. A change is a new feature, simple improvement, change in documentation or fixing of a bug. If you have multiple changes planned, you can create them in separate commits, or you can do them in separate branches.

### Commit: example
> maybe add an example of creating a change, and how to commit
